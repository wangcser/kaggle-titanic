# Classification Model for Kaggle Titanic Task

> author: ID.9276

## 1. Introduction

This task [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is use to practice machine learning skills with **classification techiques** in Kaggle for the beginner.

**Key Methods**: classification model in sklearn

## 2. Background

I have made a list of important skills for advanced maching learning engeering, there they are:

- Neural Network
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engeering

With the help of the three tasks in Kaggle: MNIST, Titanic and House Prices we can practice all the listed skills, so i use those  tasks to help me manuplate the tools in ML/DL.

For the advanced DL techiques, such asï¼š

- RNN
- GAN
- AE
- RL
- other state of the art models and methods

I can choose another tasks to practice, by the way, i have finished the digital character recognition tasks, and i will share the methods on the plantform.

The goal i practice is to achieve top 5% ~10% in each compitition, i believe the way to a better result is same to the way to understand others better models, which is the same path to the advanced engineer.

## 3. Data Analysis

## 4. Data preparing

## 5. Model Selecting

## 6. Model Tuning

## 7. Details in Coding

I think the good coding and code structure will improve the understanding of the task/data set.

I try to summary a generous machine learning code structure to suit most tasks (at least for the same kind of tasks),  here is structure i chosed up to now:

```python
Task_name
	- data_set
    - models
    - result
    - utils
    README.md
```

In each py-files, i prefer OOP coding rather than func-based coding.
